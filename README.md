# JavaFX Project

I have prior experience creating Real Time Chat Applications, although not in JavaFX specifically.
If we are all okay with pursuing that direction, that is what we'll do for this term final!

## How it works
- API
  - Authenticate Clients (Think basic Password + Salt SHA512 or HMAC) uses token for requests.
  - REST 
  - Create messages
  - Delete Messages
  - Send Messages (With Multimedia?)
  - WebSocket (Client connects via websocket to receive messages in real time.)
- Client
  - Connects to central server
  - Receives messages via websocket
  - Sends messages via HTTP API
  - Saves token to local db



What would you all like to do?

- We can have someone to design the API (I will host it)
- We can have someone handle the style of the main application.
- Someone to create Unit Tests
- and so on...
